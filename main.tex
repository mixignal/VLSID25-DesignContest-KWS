\subsubsection*{Microchip Technology’s RISC-V based PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit}

The \href{https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/mpfs-icicle-kit-es}{PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit} is a low-cost platform for evaluating the five-core Linux-capable RISC-V microprocessor subsystem, real-time execution, low-power capabilities, and peripherals of the PolarFire SoC FPGA. PolarFire SoC is ideal for power-efficient computing in applications such as audio, AI/ML, industrial automation, and IoT. The Icicle kit includes onboard memories (LPDDR4, SPI, eMMC flash) for Linux, a multi-rail power sensor, PCIe root port, Raspberry Pi, mikroBUS expansion ports, and various wired connectivity options for prototyping.

Identifying cardiac disorders at an early stage continues to be a vital and key approach to the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, recognized as a primary cause of mortality \cite{members2016heart}.  
The sound signals of the heart contain information relevant to cardiovascular disorders, which has been shown to be effective in the early identification of latent heart disease \cite{yuenyong2011framework}. Historically, medical professionals have used heart sound through \textit{auscultation} to detect cardiac disorders.
Auscultation is a clinical method that is used to hear the internal sounds of the body, usually through the use of a stethoscope. It is often used to inspect the circulatory, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems.
It is non-invasive, cost-effective, and requires minimal equipment, making it ideal for cardiac exams in small clinics or for use at home.
However, in reality, auscultation of heart sounds is heavily dependent on the experience and skills of physicians.
Cardiologists achieve an auscultation accuracy of around 80\% \cite{strunic2007detection}, while general physicians generally have an accuracy ranging from 20\% to 40\%.\cite{lam2018factors}. Computer-aided analysis through signal processing and machine learning has significantly narrowed this gap, offering enhanced tools to general physicians for more accurate diagnosis.

The standard procedure for classifying heart sounds is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:arch-heart-sound} \cite{gupta2007neural, nguyen2023heart}. It comprises three main steps: 1) signal conditioning, 2) extraction of spectral features, and 3) classification. This method is a proven method in the audio world, specifically keyword spotting (KWS) \cite{chong20220}.
